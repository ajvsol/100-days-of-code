### Day 23 - Wednesday 26th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to use `node-postgres` package to connect to a SQL cloud database.

**Thoughts**: Quite challenging, though the cloud server we were using went down halfway so I'm not sure if the debugging was failing due to that or my own code.
