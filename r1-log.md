# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Aaron Sollesse
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on September 26, 2022.

## Log

### Day 1 - Monday 26th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing basic JavaScript logical statements, loops, if statements, data types.

**Thoughts**: Fairly easy review. 

**Link to work**: 

### Day 2 - Tuesday 27th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn how to use Git on the command line. 

**Thoughts**: Quite fun and feels far more efficient than using a heavy Git GUI like I have been the past few years.

### Day 3 - Wednesday 28th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Exercises using logical operators, variables, loops and functions.

**Thoughts**: Fairly simple and logical.

### Day 4 - Thursday 29th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing variables, data types, many exercises.

**Thoughts**: Enjoyable if a bit easy.

### Day 5 - Friday 30th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: First hackathon all day.

**Thoughts**: Nice little challenge, but not very difficult.

### Day 16 - Monday 17th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning all about NodeJS, CommonJS modules and importing NPM modules.

**Thoughts**: Very interesting topic if quite unfamiliar syntax. Destructuring also feels quite alien and I need to look into it.

### Day 17 - Tuesday 18th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn how to setup an Express project, and use the fs module to parse and stringify to modify JSON.

**Thoughts**: Not too bad learning how to setup my own Node + Express project but this syntax needed for parsing and stringifying I need to practice using.

### Day 18 - Wednesday 19th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about CRUD and REST, how to use Postman to debug APIs, and how to setup GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE routes in Express.

**Thoughts**: Quite challenging. Debugging feels harder than web development where you have the browser dev tools, though I'm sure it's just because it's brand new to me.

### Day 19 - Thursday 20th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to use middleware to modularise our code, splitting up our main logic from our route handlers. Also how to use Express to serve a static site.

**Thoughts**: Lots of tricky concepts today, but I'm starting to get familiar with route handlers in Express now.

### Day 20 - Friday 21st October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Hackathon day, creating an API from scratch to interact with our client code. 

**Thoughts**: I understand creating APIs much better now, feels like the week's learning has all come together. Presentation went quite well and we probably made the most progress in the hackathon compared to our group.

### Day 21 - Monday 24th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to do basic SQL queries, make tables, and [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com) exercises. 

**Thoughts**: A bit difficult, and a dramatic shift of topic once I felt I was truly getting to grips with Express.js. Curious how SQL will tie into our project.

### Day 22 - Tuesday 25th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning more advanced SQL including JOINs, [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com) for various aspects, [pgexercises](https://pgexercises.com/questions/joins/) and [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/walkthrough.html).

**Thoughts**: SQL isn't as daunting as I thought, and quite interesting. Seeing it as similar to JavaScript now, just need to master the syntax.

### Day 23 - Wednesday 26th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to use `node-postgres` package to connect to a SQL cloud database. Rewriting my 100 Days of Code notes into a git repo, to better detail my progress and for greater accountability. 

**Thoughts**: Quite challenging, though the cloud server we were using went down halfway so I'm not sure if the debugging was failing due to that or our own code.

### Day 24 - Thursday 27th October 2022

**Today's Progress**: Mindset workshop on how to reach compromises and consensus amongst groups, progress check meeting with enablement coaches, continuing yesterday's project with Node project and managed to write several functions, delivered group presentation on offset vs cursor-based pagination.

**Thoughts**: Workshop was quite interesting and valuable since I used different probably less effective methods for disagreements before. Progress check went really well, glad I could prove I can do well on both mock interviews and coding exams. Did significant progress on the workshop in the time given, and successfully wrote a few functions using parameterised queries. Presentation went well also and was interesting learning from others' ones as well especially about arrow functions, API versioning and GraphQL.
